### 👋 Hi there, I’m Emmanuel Westra

I’m a Donaghey Scholar at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock, pursuing a double major in Mathematics and Computer Science. My interests lie at the intersection of theory and application—from algebraic structures and analysis to AI, data science, and software engineering.

### About Me

- Currently working on projects involving machine learning, data analysis, and algorithm design

- Skilled in programming languages including Python, C++, and Java
- Experienced with data science and ML libraries including Pandas, NumPy, and PyTorch

- Interested in how mathematical rigor can inform software engineering and AI development

### Beyond Code

- When I’m not building or analyzing, I enjoy reading philosophy and science. I’m always looking for ways to connect abstract mathematical ideas with real-world innovation.
